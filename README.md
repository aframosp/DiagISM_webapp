# DiagISM web app

[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/aframosp/DiagISM_webapp/main/main.py)

This repository contains the code to run the web app that can help you to predict the ISM physical information of galaxies using FIR luminosities.

The information presented in this web app has been created with the research results presented in the "Diagnosing the interstellar medium of galaxies with far-infrared emission lines" series of papers:

* [I. The [C II] 158 microns line at z~0](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...645A.133R)
* [II. [C II], [O I], [O III], [N II] and [N III] up to z=6](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220511955R)
* [III. Physical parameters of observed galaxies (This web app, in prep.)]()

Please acknowledge these papers if you have used this web app.

Keep in mind that in some cases the app can "go to sleep" due to inactivity (save resources). In such a case, you just need to "wake it up". This could take around 2 minutes.
