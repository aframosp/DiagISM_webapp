The information presented in this web app has been created with the research results presented in the "Diagnosing the interstellar medium of galaxies with far-infrared emission lines" series of papers:

* [I. The [C II] 158 microns line at z~0](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...645A.133R)
* [II. [C II], [O I], [O III], [N II] and [N III] up to z=6](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220511955R)
* [III. Physical parameters of observed galaxies (This web app, in prep.)]()
